The immersed boundary (IB) method is a mathematical framework for studying fluid-structure interaction initially developed by Charles Peskin to study blood flow through a heart valve [2]. Since its conception, the IB method has found a wide variety of applications in biofluid mechanics and has evolved into a generalized framework [3] for studying fluid-structure interaction problems.

MatIB is a simple Matlab implementation of the IB method that allows stu- dents and researchers to study fluid-structure interaction problems with min- imal overhead. MatIB is released under the MIT Open Source License1 and is free to use for any purpose. However, any resulting publications should cite MatIB’s user guide. The algorithms employed in MatIB are stated in Peskin’s review paper [3] which is an adaptation of the Lai-Peskin algorithm [1]. For clarity, we have limited the scope of our implementation and therefore should not be thought as a generalized IB toolkit. Instead, MatIB’s codebase acts as a foundation for further experimentation and extension.
